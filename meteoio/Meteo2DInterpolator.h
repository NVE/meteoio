/**
 * @page dev_2Dinterpol How to write a spatial interpolation algorithm
 * Point measurements can be spatially interpolated by MeteoIO, through the use of interpolation
 * algorithms. The user will then be able to choose for each meteorological parameter which
 * interpolations could be applicable and the system will choose (through a heuristic) which one
 * to apply at each time step (depending on the conditions of the moment, like the number of measurements).
 *
 * @section structure_2Dinterpol Structure
 * The selection of which interpolation algorithm to use at any given time step, for a given parameter is
 * performed by the Meteo2DInterpolator class. This class provides the interface for the spatial
 * interpolations. The interpolation algorithms themselves derive from the
 * InterpolationAlgorithm class that standardizes their public API (which would not be used by anything
 * but a Meteo2DInterpolator object). It contains a getQualityRating() method that must return a quality
 * index between 0 (algorithm not applicable) and 1 (perfect result if using this algorithm). This is currently
 * only based on extremely simple heuristics, using general knowledge about the applicability of the various
 * spatial interpolation methods depending on some obvious factors (number of measurement points, etc). The
 * Meteo2DInterpolator object will call this method from all the algorithms listed by the user (in his io.ini
 * configuration file) and keep the one that gets the highest score for interpolating the current parameter
 * at the current time step. The interpolation is then done calling the algorithm's calculate method.
 *
 * @section implementation_2Dinterpol Implementation
 * It is therefore necessary to create in InterpolationAlgorithms.cc (and declared in the .h) a new class,
 * nammed after the algorithm that will be implemented and inheriting InterpolationAlgorithm. Three methods need
 * to be implemented (the constructor being inherited from InterpolationAlgorithm and automatically called
 * by an object factory):
 * - void initialize(const MeteoData::Parameters& in_param)
 * - double getQualityRating()
 * - void calculate(Grid2DObject& grid)
 *
 * The initialize method takes the meteorological parameter that will be interpolated and set the param
 * private member to it. It then computes the private member nrOfMeasurments that contains the number of
 * stations that have this meteorological parameter available by calling getData(param, vecData, vecMeta), which
 * also fills the vectors vecData and vecMeta with the available data (as double) and metadata (as StationData).
 * Custom data preparation can obviously be done in this method.
 *
 * The calculate method must properly erase and reste the grid that it receives before filling it. If necessary,
 * (as is the case for precipitation, relative humidity and snow height, for example) the grid can be checked for min/max by
 * calling checkMinMax() at the end of Meteo2DInterpolator::interpolate.It can also add extra information about the
 * interpolation process (such as a regression coefficient or error estimate) to the InterpolationAlgorithm::info
 * stringstream (which will be made available to external programs, such as GUIs).
 *
 * The new class and its associated end user key must be used and its constructor called in AlgorithmFactory::getAlgorithm.
 * It is recommended that any generic statistical
 * spatial processing be implemented as a static class in libinterpol2D.cc so that it could be reused by other
 * algorithms (see for example Interpol2D::IDW and IDWCore). In any case, proper doxygen documentation
 * must be written alongside the implementation.
 *
 * @section doc_2Dinterpol Documentation
 * The newly added interpolation algorithm must be added to the list of available algorithms in
 * InterpolationAlgorithms.h with a proper description. An example can also be given in the example section
 * of the same file. Please feel free to add necessary bibliographic references to the bibliographic section!
