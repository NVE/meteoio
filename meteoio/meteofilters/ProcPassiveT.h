/**
 * @class  ProcPassiveT
 * @ingroup processing
 * @brief Filters and corrects temperatures from unventilated sensor.
 * This implements the correction described in <i>"Air Temperature Measurement Errors in Naturally Ventilated Radiation Shields"</i>, Reina Nakamura, L. Mahrt, J. Atmos. Oceanic Technol., <b>22</b>, 2005, pp 1046–1058
 * with an albedo dependency as introduced in <i>"Albedo effect on radiative errors in air temperature measurements"</i>, H. Huwald, C. W. Higgins, M.-O. Boldi, E. Bou-Zeid, M. Lehning, and M. B. Parlange, Water Resour. Res., <b>45</b>, W08431, 2009.
 *
 * If the "soft" option is given, the albedo has a value different according to snow (or no snow) on the ground. The default albedo (that is also used if snow height is nodata) can be given as a second option.
 *
 * @note This filter can ONLY be applied to air temperatures. Moreover, since it <i>might</i> depend on the radiation shield, it is highly recommended to do some tests (ie. comparisons between ventillated and unventillated sensors) before using it on a new sensor type. Hopefully a new paper would come and clarify its usability per sensor types...
