/**
 * @brief Generate daily variations of a given amplitude around a single daily average.
 * @details
 * The paremeter to be interpolated is assumed to be a daily average and a sinusoidal variation of the
 * amplitude given as argument will be generated (it is also possible to provide the "phase" or the
 * fraction of the day when the minimum is reached). If data bearing the same name followed by "_MIN" or "_MAX"
 * exist, there is no need to provide an amplitude as they will be used instead (but if the amplitude is provided, it
 * will be used as a fallback when no min or max is available).
 *
 * @code
 * [Interpolations1D]
 * TA::resample         = daily_avg
 * TA::daily_avg::range = 5
 * TA::daily_avg::phase = .25                ;assume that TA varies +/- 5K around its average during the day and reaches its minimum at 6am
 * @endcode
 * @note If both the average (the parameter itself in the data set),
 * min and max are provided, an error message will be returned.
